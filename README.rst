lintnode - a JSLint server for more expedient linting
=====================================================

I was setting up `flymake-mode`_ with JSLint_, and thinking it was
pretty great, but that rhino start-up cost is pretty big for a flymake
application.  If we just kept JSLint running, wouldn't that be a lot
faster?

Then I caught a talk on the `node.js`_ server, and saw a way.

The ``jslint.curl`` script depends on curl, but you can easily
reproduce it with any other http client.

.. _flymake-mode: http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/FlymakeJavaScript
.. _JSLint: http://www.jslint.com/
.. _node.js: http://nodejs.org/


Usage
-----

::

  $ node lintnode/app.js --port 8000 &

  $ lintnode/jslint.curl myfilthycode.js

The exit code of ``jslint.curl`` is currently not nearly as relevant
as the output on standard out.  The output should be fully compatible
with `JSLint's Rhino version`__.

Emacs Usage
-----------

See the included `flymake-jslint.el`__.

.. __: flymake-jslint.el


Configuration
-------------

# TODO - Add this to new server
#
`jslint_port` may be passed on the node command line with the
``--port`` parameter.  It defaults to 8000.

`jstlint_options` is currently only configurable by editing
``app.js``.  For documentation on JSLint's options, see `JSLint
options`_.
